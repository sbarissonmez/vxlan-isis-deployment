# VXLAN and ISIS Deployment

## VXLAN
Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) is a networking technology that enables the encapsulation of MAC-based Layer 2 Ethernet frames within Layer 3 UDP packets to aggregate and tunnel multiple Layer 2 networks across a Layer 3 infrastructure. This helps to provide greater scalability and flexibility in large-scale virtualized environments. VXLAN is capable of supporting up to 16 million logical networks and facilitates Layer 2 adjacency across IP networks. To enable broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast traffic, a multicast transmission architecture is utilized.

## IS-IS

The Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is commonly used in large service provider networks and can also be deployed in extremely large enterprise networks. IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol that provides fast convergence and excellent scalability. Similar to all link-state protocols, IS-IS is very efficient in using network bandwidth.
